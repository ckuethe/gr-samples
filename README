This project aims to collect the simplest possible examples of running
all GNU Radio blocks. Each example should focus on running a single
block with just the required inputs to run it and output GUI elements
to see the response as well as tunable variables for any parameters of
the block.

The intent of this project is that you build and install it as any
other project. The make process will run grcc on each of the .grc
files and install the produced Python files as examples. The GRC files
themselves may be used by themselves as well.

The make process is currently not working as we work out some issues
with grcc and certain designs.
